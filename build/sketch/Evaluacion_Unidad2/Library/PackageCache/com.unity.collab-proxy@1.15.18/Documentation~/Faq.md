**Which integration of Plastic SCM should I use in Unity moving forward?**

You should use the **Version Control package**, which contains Plastic SCM for Unity. This is the package the team will be actively working on moving forward. 

* Plastic's standard version control integration has been removed from editor versions, and its functionality has been ported to the Version control package.
* The Asset store plugin functionality is deprecated, as the functionality from the plugin has been ported to the Version Control package.
