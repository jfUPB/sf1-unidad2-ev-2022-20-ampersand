# Models
In this directory, we have all of the interfaces and implementations of the Models in the package's **MVP** architecture.

In `Api/` we have the interfaces that the Models take to communicate with the backend.
In `Enums/` and `Structures/` we have the supporting data structures for the interfaces in `Api/`.
In `Providers/` we have the implementations of the interfaces in `Api/`. At this moment only `Collab.cs` exists.
