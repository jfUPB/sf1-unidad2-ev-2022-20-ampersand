# Icons
This directory contains the icons for the Collaborate UI.
Dark and light theme icons are prefixed with `-dark` and `-light` respectively.
HDPI icons are prefixed with `@2x` for 32x32px for two times the width and height of the normal 16x16px.
Individual icon's `Texture Type` should be set as `Editor GUI and Legacy GUI` in the Unity Editor to ensure scaling is done correctly and alpha is respected.

## Icon colours
The basic colours of icons in Collaborate are as follows:\
Dark Theme: #C4C4C4 100% alpha\
Light Theme: #555555 100% alpha
