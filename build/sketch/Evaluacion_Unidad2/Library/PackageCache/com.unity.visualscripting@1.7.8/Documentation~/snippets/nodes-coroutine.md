<td>Enable <strong>Coroutine</strong> if you want Visual Scripting to run this node and any of its connected nodes as a coroutine. Coroutine nodes don't execute all their code in a single frame, so they can spread an effect over several frames. Coroutines can also help optimize your code. For more information on coroutines, see the Unity User Manual section on <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Coroutines.html">Coroutines</a>.</td>
